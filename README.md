his project was developed as part of the Fundamental Computing Association (FCA) at Penn State University.
Our team created an AI-driven chatbot capable of modifying and designing a website dynamically based on user text commands. The system integrates the OpenAI/Perplexity API for language understanding and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing, enabling direct and safe manipulation of web content.
The chatbot runs on a Flask backend with a WebView interface, supporting real-time rendering and interaction between the AI model and the live website.
